The ML Engineer handles large, complex datasets and creates repeatable, reusable code. The ML Engineer considers responsible AI and fairness throughout the ML model development process, and collaborates closely with other job roles to ensure long-term success of ML-based applications. The ML Engineer has strong programming skills and experience with data platforms and distributed data processing tools. The ML Engineer is proficient in the areas of model architecture, data and ML pipeline creation, and metrics interpretation. The ML Engineer is familiar with foundational concepts of MLOps, application development, infrastructure management, data engineering, and data governance. The ML Engineer makes ML accessible and enables teams across the organization. By training, retraining, deploying, scheduling, monitoring, and improving models, the ML Engineer designs and creates scalable, performant solutions.\\n\\n*Note: The exam does not directly assess coding skill.

The ML Engineer handles large, complex datasets and creates repeatable, reusable code. The ML Engineer considers responsible AI and fairness throughout the ML model development process, and collaborates closely with other job roles to ensure long-term success of ML-based applications. The ML Engineer has strong programming skills and experience with data platforms and distributed data processing tools. The ML Engineer is proficient in the areas of model architecture, data and ML pipeline creation, and metrics interpretation. The ML Engineer is familiar with foundational concepts of MLOps, application development, infrastructure management, data engineering, and data governance. The ML Engineer makes ML accessible and enables teams across the organization. By training, retraining, deploying, scheduling, monitoring, and improving models, the ML Engineer designs and creates scalable, performant solutions. *Note: The exam does not directly assess coding skill. If you have a minimum proficiency in Python and Cloud SQL, you should be able to interpret any questions with code snippets. Register now Register now The Professional Machine Learning Engineer exam does not cover generative AI, as the tools used to develop generative AI-based solutions are evolving quickly. If you are interested in generative AI, please refer to the Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path (all audiences) or the Generative AI for Developers Learning Path (technical audience). If you are a partner, please refer to the Gen AI partner courses: Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path, Generative AI for ML Engineers, and Generative AI for Developers. * * * #### Section 1: Architecting low-code ML solutions (~12% of the exam) 1.1 Developing ML models by using BigQuery ML.
